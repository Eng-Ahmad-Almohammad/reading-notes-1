## Growth Mindset :brain:
is when students understand that their abilities can be developed which mean that people are born with unique genetic structures, meaning they are initially better than others at different things. However, those with a growth mindset believe that one can always improve, catch up, or even surpass others’ natural talents.

-There are difference between Growth and fixed mindset
In \*growth mindset\*, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work brains, but in \*fixed mindset\*, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. 

## The three reminders of how I keep myself in a growth mindset:
1. **Challenges** 
 - I can view the challenge as opportunity for self improvement.

2. **Emphasize growth over speed**
  - Learning fast isn’t the same as learning well, and learning well sometimes requires allowing time for mistakes.
3. **Effort**
  - Hard work should always be rewarded before inherent skill.
4. **Learn from other people’s mistakes**
  - It’s not always wise to compare yourself to others, but it is important to realize that humans share the same weaknesses.

## Features I used to structure my page:
