# What can the Slack platform do?
- The Slack platform offers a couple of different routes to automate and enhance your Slack workspaces:

- Workflows provide a no-code solution to automate routine tasks, using predefined triggers and steps.
Slack apps use a range of APIs to access much deeper levels of customization.
You can use workflows and apps on their own, or combine them as your needs demand. Read on to learn more and decide the best route for you.

# Workflows: automate routine actions, no code needed
- Slack workflows are no-code solutions that automate routine tasks in Slack. Workflows are built with Workflow Builder using a limited set of triggers and steps.

- Triggers initiate a workflow. They may be user-invoked actions, like selecting a shortcut or reacting with an emoji. Or they could be automatic, like scheduled dates and times, or posting to a webhook.

- Steps follow the triggerâ€™s lead. A step can perform a basic task such as post a message into a conversation or prompt a user for short-form information in a modal.

- You can build custom workflows from within Slack, or start off with templates like daily stand-ups or request triaging.
